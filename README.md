6) To accept a student's marks for five subjects, compute his/her result. Student is passing if he/she
scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course. If student scores aggregate greater than 75%,
then the grade is distinguished. If aggregate is 60>= and <75 then the
Grade of first division. If aggregate is 50>= and <60, then the grade is second division. If aggregate
is 40>= and <50, then the grade is third division.

7)  To accept two numbers from user and compute smallest divisor and Greatest Common
Divisor of these two numbers.
